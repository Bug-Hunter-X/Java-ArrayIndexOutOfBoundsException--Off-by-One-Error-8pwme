This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java that leads to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.java` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from an incorrect loop condition in the array traversal, causing an attempt to access a non-existent element. This example highlights the importance of carefully checking loop boundaries when working with arrays or other index-based data structures in Java.
